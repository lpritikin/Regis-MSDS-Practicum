Pagedip enables users to create data-driven, interactive documents that foster engagement and drive smarter decision-making. Through Pagedip's widgets and technology, engagement is contained within the page which helps users to have a less fragmented viewing experience. Pagedip gathers data through their widgets that is not currently being utilized to its fullest extent. This project will aim to make this data as accurate as possible. It will also work to make this data more turnkey for Pagedip's clients so that they can best understand which content is working and what isn't.
